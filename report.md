# Project 1

## Description of Discrete Event Simulation

## Description of Project
The goal of the project is to develop a discrete event simulation of a single
server queue. In the assignment, we consider two different types of events:
arrival and departure events. The project consists of three main data structures
to use to implement the key ideas. These data structures include an event, a GEL
or a Global Event List, and a First In First Out Queue.
The project aims to generate arrival events and create departure events. In
addition, we will monitor the state of the queue and gather the relevant
statistics involved.

## Overall Project Logic

## Results and Analysis
Might need to move this over to a Latex file because of the graphs.

## Project Insights and Individual Contributions
### Ynna Lecitona (yhlecitona@ucdavis.edu)
Individual Contribution: worked on the `generate_packet()` and `schedule()`
functions. I worked on 3.3, processing an arrival event and did the simulations
for Part 1 of 3.7.
Insights: idk yet
